## About [wisnet96.com](https://www.wisnet96.com)

A fun project to celebrate [wisnet's 25th anniversary](https://www.wisnet.com/rebuilding-a-throwback-96-website-with-modern-web-technologies/). The code is a bit rough around the edges because I was using this project to evaluate Nuxt. I'm sold ❤️.    

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
